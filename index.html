<p class="text-muted">While most might think that Prithvi Theatre only hosts plays and that you can't visit it for anything else, let us take this opportunity to prove you wrong and introduce you to Prithvi Cafe situated right outside in the same compound. We can't begin to tell you how beautiful Prithvi Cafe is. You probably already have it all figured out. But we cannot stop ourselves from feeling overwhelmed every time we visit this dreamy place. Prithvi cafe and theatre is a place where the artists are celebrated, apart from serving some delicious food, kadak cutting chai and its famous Irish coffee</p>
